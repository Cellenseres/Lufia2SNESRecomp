# Semantic Decomp Verification

A function is `verified` only when its complete stated entry and exit contract
has passed comparison against the supported original ROM. The comparison covers
CPU state and WRAM, plus ordered bus effects where the function exposes them.
Partial implementations remain `draft`; unknown child behavior uses an explicit
continuation boundary.

ROM differential harnesses, mutation checks, fixtures, seeds, and temporary
selftests are maintained privately. They are not part of the public source tree
or build configuration. The ROM must never be committed or redistributed.

Public checks include the Decomp metadata validator
(`python scripts/metadata_index.py --check`), generated Consumer binding coverage,
and normal Release builds with Decomp enabled and disabled. A successful build
does not by itself promote a function to `verified`.

`src/decomp_bridge/actor_bridge.c` also contains battle and field bridges.
A later change can split these by subsystem, keeping the runtime ABI covered
by the existing tests.

## Field reload runtime regression

In-game bisect identified the complete `$83:85DC` native binding as the cause
of intermittent black field scenes after save selection or closing a menu.
The consumer temporarily used `Lufia2DecompBridge_85DC`, which reconstructs the
original setup and hands off at `$83:8637`. After the bridge repair and successful
gameplay confirmation, the complete `Lufia2DecompBridge_8385DC` is selected again.

Those tests compare the parent with explicit contracts for eleven children.
They did not reproduce the actual nested runtime dispatch, NMI or scheduler
sequence, so their green result alone did not establish runtime correctness.

The failing gameplay trace identifies the upload call at `$83:865D` to
`$80:8285`: the camera leaves X8 active, for which the upload has no native
dispatch entry. A nested call interpreter consumes its own deadline and returns
`SKIP_1` with the child still active (`S=$1FF0`, expected `$1FFA`, resume
`$80:880B`). The parent removes one unwind level and reports a normal return,
before reaching the NMI re-enable. Missing native reload children now transfer
their already-pushed guest frame to the owning interpreter. The parent preserves
the transfer's return code rather than interpreting it as a child return.

The reload ABI suite additionally checks 704 missing-entry handoffs against the
original ROM through each child entry, including CPU, guest stack, WRAM and four
transfer return codes. Replaying the recorded upload deadline against the old
bridge fails this suite. Gameplay confirmation covers loading from save selection
and repeated returns from the game menu. The corrected trace contains nine
reloads without false normal returns and fifteen completed fade-ins. Each fade-in
clears `$0581` after eight frames; the final brightness reaches `$0F`.
The full verifier passes all 518 independent jobs with this repair, including
the existing 3,456 reload ABI cases and the additional 704 handoff cases.
