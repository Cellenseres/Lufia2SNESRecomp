# Semantic Decomp Verification

A function is `verified` only when its complete stated entry and exit contract
has passed comparison against the supported original ROM. The comparison covers
CPU state and WRAM, plus ordered bus effects where the function exposes them.
Partial implementations remain `draft`; unknown child behavior uses an explicit
continuation boundary.

ROM differential harnesses, mutation checks, fixtures, seeds, and temporary
selftests are maintained privately. They are not part of the public source tree
or build configuration. The ROM must never be committed or redistributed.

Public checks include the Decomp metadata validator
(`python scripts/metadata_index.py --check`), generated Consumer binding coverage,
and normal Release builds with Decomp enabled and disabled. A successful build
does not by itself promote a function to `verified`.

`src/decomp_bridge/actor_bridge.c` also contains battle and field bridges.
A later change can split these by subsystem, keeping the runtime ABI covered
by the existing tests.

## Field reload runtime regression

In-game bisect identified the complete `$83:85DC` native binding as the cause
of intermittent black field scenes after save selection or closing a menu.
The consumer temporarily used `Lufia2DecompBridge_85DC`, which reconstructs the
original setup and hands off at `$83:8637`. After the bridge repair and successful
gameplay confirmation, the complete `Lufia2DecompBridge_8385DC` is selected again.

Those tests compare the parent with explicit contracts for eleven children.
They did not reproduce the actual nested runtime dispatch, NMI or scheduler
sequence, so their green result alone did not establish runtime correctness.

The failing gameplay trace identifies the upload call at `$83:865D` to
`$80:8285`: the camera leaves X8 active, for which the upload has no native
dispatch entry. A nested call interpreter consumes its own deadline and returns
`SKIP_1` with the child still active (`S=$1FF0`, expected `$1FFA`, resume
`$80:880B`). The parent removes one unwind level and reports a normal return,
before reaching the NMI re-enable. Missing native reload children now transfer
their already-pushed guest frame to the owning interpreter. The parent preserves
the transfer's return code rather than interpreting it as a child return.

The reload ABI suite additionally checks 704 missing-entry handoffs against the
original ROM through each child entry, including CPU, guest stack, WRAM and four
transfer return codes. Replaying the recorded upload deadline against the old
bridge fails this suite. Gameplay confirmation covers loading from save selection
and repeated returns from the game menu. The corrected trace contains nine
reloads without false normal returns and fifteen completed fade-ins. Each fade-in
clears `$0581` after eight frames; the final brightness reaches `$0F`.
The full verifier passes all 518 independent jobs with this repair, including
the existing 3,456 reload ABI cases and the additional 704 handoff cases.

## Battle wave table integration

The feature repair selects `$85:ADE1`, `$85:AE68`, `$85:AEEB` and `$85:AA3D`
through standalone replacements. These leaf bridges require native M1X0 in
bank `$85`, accept both decimal modes and preserve the two-byte JSR frame.
The return frame must lie in the bank-zero WRAM mirror, including any extra
byte required for a paired host return. Rejected entries transfer unchanged to
the owning interpreter before any memory access.

Private original-ROM comparisons cover 4,352 ABI cases across three host-return
modes and 60 rejected entries. Mutation checks detect a wrong return-frame
size, lost overflow and an omitted program-bank guard. The three wave builders
additionally pass 196,608 comparisons spanning every 16-bit phase value. The
integrated Release build and all 518 existing verification jobs pass. These
checks do not establish interrupt scheduling or rendered PPU behavior.

The repaired feature remains isolated: 376 standalone replacements are selected
and 85 unverified feature drafts retain static recomp selection. A complete
entry/exit and child-call contract, ROM comparisons and consumer ABI evidence
are required before selecting each further draft.

## Menu palette integration

The five fixed palette loaders `$86:90C0`, `$86:90D3`, `$86:90E6`, `$86:90F9`
and `$86:910C` preserve the original bank `$9F` MVN transfers and RTL boundary.
Their bridges accept either M width, X16 and both decimal modes in bank `$86`.
Entry guards require native mode and a WRAM return frame before reading it.

The ABI oracle checks actual native selection as well as resulting behavior:
8,960 native calls, 1,600 unchanged fallbacks and 60 explicit rejected entries
pass across three host-return modes. Focused cases include palette output
overlapping saved stack bytes. Wrong RTL size, overflow and program-bank guards
are detected by mutations. The earlier motion repair passed all 518 jobs and
the Release build; the combined nine-binding snapshot also passes all 518 jobs and Release.
Its first run timed out in object-update-abi during a concurrent large matrix;
an unchanged rerun without that matrix passes within the existing timeout.


## World perspective plane integration

The complete `$86:A894` parent is selected for its original bank-86 caller
context: M1X0, DP0, PB/DB86 and S in `$1F00..$1FFC`. The semantic entry and
bridge reject other contexts before any memory access. Its four row builders
share the parent implementation; their independent entry contracts remain
draft. The parent matrix covers 262,144 original-ROM comparisons over all byte
angles/tilts, both calculation branches and decimal modes. Consumer checks
assert 16,384 actual native executions and 24 unchanged entry handoffs. Seven
mutations of frame size, overflow and guards are detected. No consumer hook
lies within the plane or its inlined children.

The ten-binding checkpoint, including the shared width-aware arithmetic and
ordered word reads, passes all 518 independent jobs and Release. Selection lists
376 standalone replacements and 85 draft candidate fallbacks. Independent CPU
adapter tests pass 1,048,576 interpreter comparisons; word-order properties pass
458,752 cases with each of MSVC and clang. Interrupt scheduling and rendered
PPU timing are outside these plane-table comparisons.
