# Semantic Decomp Verification

A function is `verified` only when its complete stated entry and exit contract
has passed comparison against the supported original ROM. The comparison covers
CPU state and WRAM, plus ordered bus effects where the function exposes them.
Partial implementations remain `draft`; unknown child behavior uses an explicit
continuation boundary.

ROM differential harnesses, mutation checks, fixtures, seeds, and temporary
selftests are maintained privately. They are not part of the public source tree
or build configuration. The ROM must never be committed or redistributed.

Public checks include the Decomp metadata validator
(`python scripts/metadata_index.py --check`), generated Consumer binding coverage,
and normal Release builds with Decomp enabled and disabled. A successful build
does not by itself promote a function to `verified`.

`src/decomp_bridge/actor_bridge.c` also contains battle and field bridges.
A later change can split these by subsystem, keeping the runtime ABI covered
by the existing tests.
